# Automated-ProgramBook-Producer
Automates creation of conference program books from online speaker submissions

Automated-ProgramBook-Producer is a GitHub project designed to streamline the creation of conference program books by automating the collection and formatting of speaker information into structured Word documents. Here is the a proposed idea as an example solution, maybe not the best solution. 

### Project Title
**Automated Speaker Information Submission and Document Generation System for CABS Biopacific Conference**

### Project Objective
Develop an automated system where conference speakers can submit their information online, and a formatted Word document is automatically generated for each submission. This system should reduce manual data entry, minimize errors, and streamline the process of compiling a digital program book.

### Project Tasks
1. **System Design**
   - Design an online form for speakers to submit their personal and presentation information.
   - Determine the required fields to ensure comprehensive data collection (e.g., name, title, affiliation, bio, LinkedIn link, presentation title, and abstract).

2. **Data Storage Solution**
   - Set up a Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel Online spreadsheet to automatically capture form responses.
   - Consider a database solution for more robust data management if necessary.

3. **Automated Document Creation**
   - Use Microsoft Power Automate to integrate form responses with Microsoft Word for automatic document creation.
   - Create a document template with placeholders for each data field to ensure uniform formatting.

4. **Quality Control Workflow**
   - Implement an automated email notification system for speakers to review their generated document.
   - Develop a process for speakers or reviewers to submit corrections or approve documents.

5. **Document Management and Compilation**
   - Store generated documents in a structured cloud storage system like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.
   - Automate the compilation of individual documents into a master file according to the conference agenda.

6. **Feedback and Iteration**
   - After the conference, collect feedback from users and reviewers to refine the system.
   - Update the system based on feedback to improve functionality and user experience.

### Desired Outcomes
- A fully functional system that can handle the end-to-end process from data submission to document generation.
- Reduced workload for conference organizers and increased accuracy in the program book.
- Valuable hands-on experience for interns in developing automated systems and handling project management.

### Evaluation Metrics
- User satisfaction with the submission process.
- Accuracy of the generated documents.
- Time saved compared to the manual process.
